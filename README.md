# CI/CD workflow 

## Tools I Used

-  **Github** as repo source
- **Github Action** for continous Integration

- **Gradle** for building the java app
- **sonarQube** inorder to collects and analyzes source code, and provides reports for the code quality of this project
- **Nexus** is a repo that supports many artifact formats, like Docker, Javaâ„¢
- **Docker** inorder to containerize the app
-  **Kubernetes** inorder to orchestrate the containerized app
- **Datree.io** is used to identify misconfiguration in k8s manifest files


This application is java spring boot web application  

build tool is ** gradle **

when we build the code using command ```./gradlew build ``` it will generate war file. that war can be placed in tomcat server to see application web page

code is integrated with sonarqube plugin which help us in static code analysis 

``` ./gradlew sonarqube ```
